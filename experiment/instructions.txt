In this experiment we are testing how well people can pay attention 
to specific moments in time, and judge what they saw at those moments. 

On each trial you will see up to two horizontal or vertical gratings
flash on the screen one after another. Your task is to judge if they 
are tilted slightly clockwise or counterclockwise from horizontal 
or vertical axes.

Before the gratings appear, you will a tone that will tell 
you which grating to pay attention to. A high tone 
means pay attention to the first grating. 
A low tone means pay attention to the second grating.
 If you hear both tones together, pay attention to both stimuli. 
During the task there will be two click sounds, which
indicate when each grating may appear.

After they two patches flash, you will hear a tone that will tell 
you which grating's orientation to report on this trial. A high tone tells you to 
report how the first grating was tilted. A low tone tells you to report 
how the second grating was tilted. 

You can press '1' to respond that it was tilted 
counter-clockwise, and  '2' to respond that it was clockwise.
If you do not see a patch, press '3' key.

After you respond, you will get feedback on how you did. 
Green = correct, red = incorrect. 

This task is meant to be difficult, so don't be discouraged if 
it feels tricky - try your best! Thank you for participating in our study.
