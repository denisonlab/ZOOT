In this experiment we are testing how well people can pay attention 
to specific moments in time, and judge what they saw at those moments. 

On each trial you will see up to two patches with horizontal or vertical 
lines flash on the screen one after another. Your task is to judge if they 
are tilted slightly clockwise or counterclockwise from purely horizontal 
or vertical.

Before the patches appear, you will a tone that will tell 
you which patch you are most likely to be asked to report on. A high tone 
before the patches appear means you are most likely to be asked about the 
first patch. A low tone means you are most likely to be asked about the second 
patch. If you hear both tones together, you will have an equal chance of being 
asked about either patch. During the task there will be two click sounds, which
indicate when each patch may appear.

After they two patches flash, you will hear a tone that will tell 
you which patch to respond to on this trial. A high tone tells you to 
report how the first patch was tilted. A low tone tells you to report 
how the second patch was tilted. 

You can press the 1 button to respond that it was tilted 
counter-clockwise, and the 0 button to respond that it was clockwise.
If you do not see a patch, press the M key.

After you respond, you will get feedback on how you did. 
Green = correct, red = incorrect, blue = no response. 

This task is meant to be difficult, so don't be discouraged if 
it feels tricky - try your best! Thank you for participating in our study.
